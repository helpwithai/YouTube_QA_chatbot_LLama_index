**YouTube_QA_chatbot_LLama_index**

LlamaIndex is a versatile framework designed to empower LLM applications to ingest, structure, access, and retrieve data from private sources. This framework allows us to create context-rich and relevant models using our custom data. LlamaIndex and LlamaHub offer integrations for various data types, whether structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

**Key Features:**

- **YouTube Video Indexing:** The application takes a YouTube video URL as input from the user and indexes the video transcript as a Document in the Vector Store.

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can engage in conversation with the chatbot, asking questions related to the indexed video content.

- **Knowledge Augmentation:** The LLM (LLAMA 2) benefits from the information stored in the Vector Store, ensuring that the model provides insightful responses based on the video content, powered by LlamaIndex's chat engine.

- **Chat History:** The app stores and updates the chat history, allowing users to review previous interactions.

- **In-Memory Vector Store:** The application maintains the vector store in memory for the duration of a given session.
