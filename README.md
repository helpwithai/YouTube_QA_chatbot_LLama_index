The process of enhancing LLMs with custom data poses a significant challenge, primarily due to the diverse array of data formats involved, ranging from JSON to video, audio, PDF, and the potential dispersion of these data sources across various repositories like Elasticsearch or SQL databases. This is precisely where Llamaindex steps in, bridging the divide and simplifying the integration of these varied data sources into your chatbot's knowledge base.

LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a flexible framework that enables LLM applications to ingest, structure, access, and retrieve private data source. This allows us to build context rich and relevant models on our custom data. LlamaIndex and LlamaHub provide integrations for almost any type of data integrations may it be structured, semi-structured or unstructured.
